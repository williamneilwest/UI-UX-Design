# UI-UX-Design




For this project, I was tasked with creating an Android application using one of three prompts. The prompt I chose was for an inventory application that would track items and give users the ability to add and remove items from the database. There is also a separate database for user authentication purposes. Each user will need to create an account before utilizing the application. There were essentially two screens for this simple application: a login activity and the database list. I utilized Android Studio to code this app, which has virtual devices that llowed me to test the app during coding. The program also has a design feature that allows developers to add elements such as buttons and text views without knowing the exact code implementation for those elements. The most successful part of the app is the integration of SQLite into the program in order to keep track of user-authentication and the inventory databse.
